# Brian-Schiele-Activity15
A repository to help introduce me to Github.
The data for this repo comes from R packagaes such as dcData, and publicly available US Armed Forces Data.
In the main branch you can find all files, and in the dev branch you can find the specific code that was used to create the qmd file.
If any questions come to mind, contact me at bhs5237@psu.edu
